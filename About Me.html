    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Here you'll get to learn a bit about who I've been, who I am, and who I aspire to be. Understanding identity is important to any prospective employer, collaborator, or assessor, and I hope this helps you envision my potential value, my ability to address some need in your current situation.</p>

    <h2>Place: Where I'm From, Where I've Been, Where I Am, Where I'm Going</h2>
      <p>First, I think it'll be helpful to discuss the many different places I've lived, and how I think my interactions in those spaces helps make me who I am. I was born in Rockford, IL, a city roughly 2 hours west of Chicago.</p>
