    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p><em>Side note: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/engl1302/about-me">Here</a> you can access another "About Me" page on my Capstone Project, which is published on an ENGL 1302/First-Year writing class website.</em></p>
    <p>Here you'll get to learn a bit about who I've been, who I am, and who I aspire to be. Understanding identity is important to any prospective employer, collaborator, or assessor, and I hope this helps you envision my potential value, my ability to address some need in your current situation.</p>

    <h2>Place: Where I'm From, Where I've Been, Where I Am, Where I'm Going</h2>
      <p>First, I think it'll be helpful to discuss the many different places I've lived, and how I think my interactions in those spaces helps make me who I am. I was born in Rockford, IL, a city roughly two hours west of Chicago. For those unfamiliar with the city, it's a stereotypical Midwestern rust belt industrial city. From the beginning, I've considered myself blue collar, working class. My dad, also born in the area, worked in corrugating factories his whole life, was a marine who served in the Persian Gulf War, and instilled in me a sense of orderliness and a relentless hard work ethic. My mom, a Colombian immigrant, also reinforced the need for hard work and to pursue an education that might lift us above the lower-middle class conditions my father lived in, living paycheck to paycheck for most of his life.</p>

      <p>From Rockford our family moved every couple of years, as my dad found better work opportunities elsewhere, incrementally making a stronger income upon each relocation. Our family moved next to Akron, OH, an industrial center downtown, and I attended kindergarten at St. Mary's/St. Vincent's, the school where NBA superstar LeBron James had attended. Our family was ardently Catholic and strict in many measures.</p>

      <p>We moved to Robertsdale, AL, to another working-class neighborhood, and there as a child I confronted racism for the first time as my mother continually was degraded and insulted because of her accent and skin color. And the economic conditions, I saw, were intimately tied to views on race and politics.</p>

      <p>Then we moved to the west coast, central California, Modesto. We returned to Akron again, and then made our way back to northern IL, though this time to a small rural town called Durand, where I went through middle and high school.</p>

    <h2>Scholarly Interests & Professional Goals</h2>

    Perhaps it's best I list my current research/profession interests here:
    <ul>
      <li>Writing studies/composition, as well as learning theory</li>
      <li>First-Year Writing: best classroom/curricular practices</li>
    </ul>
