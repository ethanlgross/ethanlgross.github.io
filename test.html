    <h1>This is the first-level, top-level heading.</h1>
    <p>This <strong>is</strong> the <em>paragraph</em> element. <a href="index.html">Link to the first page.</a> The organâ€™s <b>sharp</b>, ironclad <cite>exhale</cite>. As <q>if</q> a <i>venomous</i> vapor it slowly suffocates, calmly chokes blurred, anonymous veils and suits spotting empty mahogany benches, testing the integrity of the oakwood, high-rise beams and sending a shiver through the rainbow-colored stained glass, Eden here and crucifix there. White shards of sunlight interrogate the living, and a somber black cassock, guarding what <a href="index.html">appears</a> to be a <casket, stands stiff, palm in pointed palm, at a polished granite altar that mercilessly grips the creased whites behind his thin, round spectacles. Sound stops, and the dust particles dance in the sunlight as all becomes still on Earth. Behind the cassock creaks open the casket.</p>
