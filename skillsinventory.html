    <h1><strong>Skills inventory</strong></h1>
    <p><em>Note: I've manually converted this page, originally written in Markdown, to HTML. I thought it might be a helpful practice exercise, and a way to show evidence of learning in DigiRhet.<em></p>

  <ol>
    <li><em>What do you know how to do?</em></li>
    <li><em>How comfortable are you with the technologies?</em></li>
    <li><em>How comfortable are you with playing with the technologies? (sidenote: what’s the difference between skill and play?)</em></li>
  </ol>

<p><em><strong>Side note:</strong> I'm listed first because this is late work, and I know you've already read everyone else's.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Side side note:</strong> These are, as I understand them, not my "skills." I think they're complex programs/tools with which I have some experience interacting (resulting from initial play) to accomplish (or not) some goal. But I wouldn't say they're on my Batman utility belt; they're some things I've had experience doing that might relate to things we'll be doing in this course.</em></p>


<p><strong>Some relevant digital "skills,"</strong> in descending order of comfortableness:
  <ul>
    <li>Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access)</li>
    <li>[Google](www.google.com) (Drive, Docs, Sites)</li>
    <li>Sending emails, professional correspondence</li>
    <li>Adobe (Editing PDFs)</li>
    <li>[YouTube](www.youtube.com)</li>
    <li>Misc softwares</li>
    <li>How to clean, defragment, organize, customize, maximize using basic PC settings</li>
    <li>How to ask somebody for help when I'm lost (common)</li>
    <li>Learning Markdown, HTML/CSS, and GitHub in this class (note this is last on the list)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Comfortableness</strong> in playing with these technologies: yes. Comfortableness in demonstrating <em>proficiency</em>: not likely.</p>

<p><strong>Skill vs. play:<strong> I think "play" happens in exploration, in research-to-learn activities not bounded by fully-fledged goals/purposes. In time through play, these goals/purposes form as tool user, tool, and social/material bases give way to the exigency of the situation. Then, the individual instances of play with tools in various situations are mined to make choices in the aforementioned situation. "Skills" are then the tools of habituated play as called upon to perform tasks in certain situations.</p>
