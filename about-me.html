			  <p>As a professional and academic in English studies, I've earned a B.A. in English at the University of Houston Victoria, and I am currently working on my M.A. in English with a concentration in writing studies at Texas A&M University Corpus Christi. Before entering the classroom full-time, I worked as an English tutor/writing consultant at Victoria College.</p>
			  
			  <p>Now to the personal. I've lived all over the country, I enjoy playing sports and running when I'm not reading something and self-caffeinating, and I write poetry and short (non)fiction. Before committing to the classroom to be here with you all, I also worked for six years as an auto technician. I firmly believe my time working on cars and with folks in the auto industry continues to inform my studies and practice.</p>
			  
			  <p>If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to contact me! I'm always here and happy to help, and I will follow-up with you as soon as possible.</p>
