    <p>This page acts as a bit of a repository for my work in ENGL 5369 - Digital Rhetoric. This entire profile/website was built using GitHub, Atom, and various other tools that I had never been aware of prior to this course.</p>

    <p>You can access my first HTML writing experience here, on a page called <a href="test.html">"test.html"</a></p>
